Found a logic but am not able to implement it. If we do not consider C to be in any string then X can be converted to Y if
number of A's in X equal number of B's in Y and for every A in X, it's index is lesser than it's corresponding A in Y. If
we consider C, then for every C in Y, there should be a C in X and we just have to check for strings in between C's in Y.
